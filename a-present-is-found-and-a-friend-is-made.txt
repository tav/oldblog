 | time. 2am. place. the wobbly (millennium) bridge.
 |
 | after entertaining myself running around the trees, i pull
 | myself up onto the wobbly bridge and gently skip along. my
 | heart beats slightly faster as i see the river flow underneath
 | me. the thrill of being so high. the thrill of falling.
 |
 | clumsily pull myself over the side, straddle a beam and sit,
 | watching the river flow. i lean back, feel the aura of the
 | full moon. the wind blows. so soft. but with a sharpness that
 | makes me alert. aware. lyrics come to mind "london calling to
 | the underworld... i live by the river!"

.. more
 |
 | i get up to climb back over. i almost slip. heart beats. back
 | on the wobbly. start to skip along again. in front of me, a
 | giant circle. a perfect circle. a circle of objects. i look
 | around -- no-one to be seen. a present from an anonymous
 | stranger.
 |
 | i delight in the find and start exploring. a mobile phone. a
 | paintbrush. a block of wood. a pressure valve. a blue tin
 | (labelled russian caviar). i look inside. some round stones.
 | another block of wood. too many objects to be mentioned here.
 | the wind takes on a cold edge, but the present makes me very
 | warm.
 |
 | and in the middle of this perfect circle, at the exact middle
 | of the bridge (both lengthways and sideways), a grey and
 | white toy bunny with a fat blue alkaline battery. i ponder
 | upon the present for a long time. is there a clever message?
 |
 | for some reason, the words "beautiful girl lovely dress"
 | sample across my mind's ear. a cyclist zooms by. i call back
 | at him. he stops. he turns. he approaches cautiously. i ask
 | him what he thinks. maybe a clock he says. doesn't have
 | anything interesting to say. i let him go.
 |
 | i explore the present further. time goes by. i feel inspired.
 | thoughts provoked. another walks by. i wave. we speak. i can
 | sense the samani in this creature. we will be good friends.
 |
 | i bid the present goodbye, and decide to spend the remaining
 | hours of the morning exploring the mind of this new found
 | friend. and fun hours they were.
