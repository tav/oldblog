Myself and other crazy visionaries will be speaking in Manchester on the 3rd of
November for the `Media Ecologies Workshop
<http://www.espach.salford.ac.uk/sssi/p2p/>`_.

Put together by `Phoebe Moore
<http://www.espach.salford.ac.uk/page/Phoebe_Moore>`_, it promises to be a rare
gathering of various pioneering efforts -- from those working on collaborative
platforms to `distributed manufacturing
<http://www.espach.salford.ac.uk/sssi/p2p/programme.html>`_ efforts.

Sadly it's only a one day event -- so if anyone wants to organise a follow-up
event for the next day, it'd certainly be very welcome!

Some of the speakers like the illustrious `Michel Bauwens
<http://www.google.com/search?q=michel+bauwens>`_ of the `P2P Foundation
<http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/>`_ will be coming over from distant lands and
it'd be a shame to only get a day of their time.

In any case, I hope that you can come to Manchester for the event -- it's free!
