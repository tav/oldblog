========================
Happy Birthday Matthieu!
========================

Tomorrow, it's the birthday of the Rey-Grange twins: `Matthieu
<http://mattrg.free.fr/>`_ and Stan. I'd like to wish them a brilliant day and a
magical year!

Matthieu was my housemate of 2 years @ Brushfield Riva and is the best housemate
that I've ever had!

He is one of the kindest souls that one is ever likely to meet and a real
pleasure to hang out with.

Wise, talented, fun, interesting, helpful -- everything that one could ever hope
for in a friend, one finds with Matt.

He not only turned around my impression of the French, but also gave me reasons
to appreciate many aspects of its culture.

Lots of love to you brother and happy birthday!!
