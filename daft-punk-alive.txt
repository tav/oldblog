This year has been great for music. My favourite musician, `A. R. Rahman
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._R._Rahman>`_, won 2 Oscars whilst my favourite
band, `Daft Punk <http://www.myspace.com/daftpunk>`_, won 2 Grammys!

As much as one might try to hate the French, you just can't knock Daft Punk.
Their music is great and they are amazing performers.

But for the love of Google, I have been able to find sweet fuck all for `Daft
Punk tour dates in 2009
<http://www.google.com/search?q=daft+punk+tour+dates+2009>`_.

So if any of you happen to know where they can be seen in the near future,
please let me know in the comments!!

And if any of you happen to know them personally, then I'd love for them to
perform at my birthday sometime. It doesn't have to be this year, next year is
fine too ;p
