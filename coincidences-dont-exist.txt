Not to be a `fatalist <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism>`_, but I'm
increasingly observing how frequently "coincidences" seem to be taking place.

Case in point, this morning `Zooko <https://zooko.com/log.html>`_ messaged me
out of the blue. It's been a few months since we last spoke and was nice to
briefly catch up. He pointed me to his latest work -- `AllMyData.com
<http://www.allmydata.com>`_ -- an online storage service running on `Tahoe
<http://www.allmydata.org>`_, the P2P network he's been working on.

And it just so happened that earlier this evening, I was in need of a storage
service to integrate into the coming Bootstrap specification. AllMyData happens
to be one of the best fits -- closely shadowed by `box.net
<http://www.box.net>`_.

Neither contact from Zooko nor the need for a storage service is particularly
surprising. But for it to happen on the same day is a pretty low probability.
And on its own, not so surprising.

But taken together with all the other hundreds of little opportune coincidences
that seem to take place in my life, I begin to wonder if coincidences really are
coincidences?
