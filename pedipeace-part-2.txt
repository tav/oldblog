==================
Pedipeace (Part 2)
==================

*[This is a reposting of an email that I had sent to some close friends on March
26th 2003 @ 05:35.]*

::

 | 	george> The theory of blocking off central London is a good
 | 	george> one but it will still piss people off to fuck.
 | 
 | true. but, we should frame it as pedestrianising for peace as opposed
 | to blocking off central london.
 | 
 | although it amounts to the same thing, one is confrontational, the other...

.. more
 | 
 | 	george> Sounds like the stuff Reclaim The Streets tries to
 | 	george> do but with better ideas, dialogue instead of
 | 	george> marching. But that affair always gets hijacked by
 | 	george> rioters who are pissed off at the police.
 | 
 | surely we shouldn't resign ourselves to accepting that as the only
 | possible outcome? if everyone is aware of it before, can't we take
 | precautions against it?
 | 
 | on a side note, are people familiar with the roerich banner of peace?
 | it's the three red dots symbolising art, science, and religion, with a
 | red circle around them representing the totality of culture. the red
 | itself represents the colour of the one blood that unites us all.
 | 
 | (btw, can someone come up with an alternative meaning for the third dot?
 | religion can be quite shitty...)
 | 
 | here is a quick quote:
 | 
 | //
 |   The Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace movement grew rapidly during
 |   the early nineteen-thirties, with centers in a number of countries.
 |   There were three international conferences, in Bruges, Belgium, in
 |   Montevideo, Uruguay, and in Washington, D.C. The Pact itself
 |   declared the necessity for protection of the cultural product and
 |   activity of the world-both during war and peace-and prescribed the
 |   method by which all sites of cultural value would be declared neutral
 |   and protected, just as the Red Cross does with hospitals. Indeed,
 |   the Roerich Pact was often called The Red Cross of Culture.
 | 
 |   Just as the Red Cross is embodied in a protective sign and banner,
 |   so does the Roerich Pact also designate a symbol-the one seen on
 |   this page-to be displayed on a banner, The Banner of Peace. This
 |   Banner, flown at all sites of cultural activity and historical value,
 |   would declare them neutral, independent of combatant forces.
 | //
 | 
 | i suggest we adopt the banner of peace for the pedipeace movement. that
 | nicholas roerich and ghandi knew and influenced each other lends us even
 | more weight.
 | 
 | 	george> possible problems could be the way people would
 | 	george> be spread so thinly that it would be easy for
 | 	george> the bacon patrol to break up these small groups
 | 	george> and arrest/beat people without getting too noticed.
 | 
 | good point.
 | 
 | we need to keep the number of circles down until we've gathered enough
 | people then. as long as we make people aware of issues like these, then
 | they are likely to be relatively sensible?
 | 
 | 	george> Do you really think they will allow sound systems
 | 	george> and parties in the street? They will seize your
 | 	george> equipment straight away because of that repetitive
 | 	george> beats law.
 | 
 | then, let's find out more places like those UCL halls on oxford street,
 | where we could have sound systems blasting from within the buildings
 | themselves.
 | 
 | the key is to get awareness out there. if it's just isolated pockets,
 | then it is very easy for them to picked off. but if everyone is doing it...
 | 
 | 	george> A huge fiesta taking up the whole of zone 1
 | 	george> would be amazing though. A lot of people
 | 	george> would go just for a good time, not caring
 | 	george> about the causes, and the more people the better.
 | 
 | yes! yes! yes!
 | 
 | (but even those who don't care so much will have their interest piqued
 | by the dialogues, and would hopefully gradually end up participating).
 | 
 | 	george> But a lot of people that live in central are
 | 	george> rich and old and used to the world and happy with
 | 	george> the way things go on, so they won't support
 | 	george> you, but get pissed off by all the rowdiness.
 | 
 | now, this does worry me. how can we minimise this?
 | 
 | how can we also minimise the impact of the extremist militants / agent
 | provocateurs?
 | 
 | how do we ensure that the police will never be able to resort to
 | truncheons and tear gases?
 | 
 | 	george> It seems the whole protest/marching thing is
 | 	george> still popular (though showing lack of imagination)
 | 	george> when people feel strongly about a cause, but a
 | 	george> lot of the people who do care won't go because
 | 	george> they won't see the point, so many marches and so
 | 	george> little effect. The whole idea is stale and so
 | 	george> usual it goes unnoticed.
 | 
 | right, we all know people (including ourselves), who although they agree
 | with the sentiments of no war, at times, don't think it's of any use to
 | go down to the marches.
 | 
 | 	george> Expressing your discontent is no good if
 | 	george> no-one listens.
 | 
 | *nod*
 | 
 | one of the reason i find marches such a farce is because of the way they
 | are isolated from the rest of society. even on feb 15th, with a million
 | odd marching through london, to most londoners it was just a normal
 | day... the protests completely separate from their lives.
 | 
 | 	george> This is a foolish attitude because it is because
 | 	george> people choose not to join in that there are not
 | 	george> enough people to make a difference.
 | 
 | how do we get people to realise this? and, more importantly, to act on it?
 | 
 | 	george> If the whole country united for change it
 | 	george> could come about but too many people take
 | 	george> the 'one man can't make a difference' attitude.
 | 
 | well, with the dialogues, i'm thinking that we could reverse this mentality.
 | 
 | basically, if you aren't there participating, then you effectively lose
 | your voice. so as to encourage all people to come and participate.
 | 
 | 	george> Basically, i think the number of people taking
 | 	george> part in ya proposed idea would be outweighed by
 | 	george> the number not, and it would be hard to
 | 	george> organise them.
 | 
 | but, if only a hundred thousand participated on the first day, that's
 | still substantial?
 | 
 | do it on a nice sunny sunday... get half a million people down?
 | 
 | i agree about it being difficult to organise them, but it's not impossible.
 | 
 | 	george> I think you have too much faith in the genral public.
 | 
 | the general public has to come to realise their own power. otherwise,
 | there is no hope.
 | 
 | 	george> Although many will agree with you 'in theory' only a
 | 	george> much smaller hardcore will be motivated enough to
 | 	george> actually get organised about it...
 | 
 | let's get *everyone* down. this isn't going to be a short war.
 | 
 | we just need to create enough inertia to push people past the "agree in
 | theory" phase. it needs to be such a definite, that people will not even
 | think of using their cars on that day.
 | 
 | let's sort out alternative bus routes. let's sort out routes to the
 | major hospitals so that people's lives aren't endangered.
 | 
 | let's sort out routes for the police so that they can clamp down if
 | anyone starts throwing rocks at starbucks. let's sort out traffic routes
 | to direct people. let's sort out toilets and dustbins.
 | 
 | let's get people like ms dynamite weaving their magic in the streets.
 | let's get *everyone* involved. not just radicals. let's have members of
 | parliament having dialogues with the average man on the street. let's
 | have policemen participating. let's have teachers. let's have doctors.
 | 
 | let's appeal to mothers of conscience to stand in protection of the
 | circles. will police dare beat up pregnant women? will police dare to
 | beat up young children? will police dare beat up respected religious
 | leaders? will police dare beat up the elderly?
 | 
 | let's have an independent media coverage throughout london. let's setup
 | terminals at all tube stations. where people could come and at the push
 | of a button print out the latest summary of events and dialogues.
 | 
 | 	george> Keep trying and thinking about this hoipefully people
 | 	george> will soon not be resigned to acceptance.
 | 
 | deep in their hearts, i believe people are tired of the bollocks that
 | they put up with on a day to day basis. i believe that people do want a
 | better future. they just don't see how it will be possible or what they
 | can do.
 | 
 | once they realise that it is possible and that they can help make it a
 | reality, i believe that they will awaken.
 | 
 | 	george> Also, we are only slaves to oil because we are not
 | 	george> given alternate energy sources to meet all our needs.
 | 	george> Sure they exist but reamin out of our hands.
 | 
 | true. but something as simple as not using our cars. and switching over
 | our electricity to ecotricity would be a good start...
 | 
 | 	chris> i think you can reach people and get them motivated,
 | 	chris> its all about language.
 | 
 | agreed. it's all about perception.
 | 
 | 	chris> Create your own infastructure and co-opt the existing
 | 	chris> one to reach people.
 | 
 | from a media perspective, i think we are onto a winner here.
 | 
 | see, most road blockades and marches don't get any press coverage not
 | because of some global media conspiracy (yes, there is a certain element
 | of that), but mainly because it's not news that sells.
 | 
 | *oh look! yet another student has chained herself to a tree!*
 | 
 | just not interesting enough.
 | 
 | we need something that is dynamic. something that will get people's
 | minds and hearts racing. something people (i.e. the populace as a whole,
 | not just a minority) can get passionate about. something they will buy
 | the next days papers to read about.
 | 
 | we can do that here.
 | 
 | we have a sensationalist background of conflict. this will keep people
 | on their toes. the police will be out in the thousands. the people will
 | be out in the hundreds of thousands.
 | 
 | but that will merely be a backdrop. the key is to refuse to let that
 | become the key issue. if we do, then all is lost. so, we should maintain
 | the sensationalism of that, yet focus on the dialogue that is important.
 | 
 | let papers be filled with reports sent in from the various circles. let
 | papers create maps of what's happening at which crossroads. let papers
 | be crammed with wonderful photos of people celebrating life.
 | 
 | let the banners of peace fly. let wonderful smells fill the air. let the
 | magical sounds of music sweep people up into ecstasy. let love blossom
 | under the spring sun.
 | 
 | we could do experiments in art and science. in art, maybe as a grand
 | symbol, we could build a wall around the american embassy like they did
 | in rome! in the sciences, we could create community based wireless
 | networks! we can do fun things. we can push the boundaries.
 | 
 | 	chris> no-one told people that they have to take responsibility
 | 	chris> for what their country is doing, educate themselves and
 | 	chris> regain control of their lives. They just used language
 | 	chris> that contained no responsibility.
 | 
 | chris (and others), could you have a go at phrasing what i am saying
 | into "better" words please. i think i am reasonably good at avoiding
 | trigger words, and in fact constantly make up new words in order to do
 | so, but am sure it could all be phrased a lot better.
 | 
 | thanks!
 | 
 | 	matt> the police WILL NOT LET DEMOCRACY OCCUR IN THE STREETS.
 | 	matt> If you try to make this happen and advertise it as if
 | 	matt> it will be fluffy and lovely and discursive, you will
 | 	matt> just be fooling people who will end up with a truncheon
 | 	matt> in their face.
 | 
 | i beg to differ.
 | 
 | yes, i agree, the inertia is currently against our favour. but we don't
 | have to let it be so. the key is for us to strike pre-emptively. not on
 | the streets. but in the court of public opinion.
 | 
 | i have been thinking that we should perhaps highlight events such as the
 | tiananmen square massacre and genoa. make people aware of what really
 | happened. (funny, those chinese were asking for more democracy and
 | accurate press coverage just like we are doing so now...).
 | 
 | the developments that took place in the lead up to those events needs to
 | become common knowledge. the key here is to do it such that the police
 | would not be able to tear gas innocents without a public backlash. at
 | the same time, we must take care to avoid instilling paranoia, e.g. the
 | black bloc in genoa...
 | 
 | also, what are famous scenes from movies? star wars is pretty good. we
 | should make use of strong imagery in movies, books and songs to get the
 | point across. we should emphasise the history of the likes of ghandi.
 | (perhaps we should all dress up like him?)
 | 
 | the police are, at the end of the day, people just like the rest of us.
 | they are influenced by the opinion of others just as we all are. they
 | too have children, husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers,
 | friends, lovers. they too are influenced by what those people think.
 | 
 | london can ring with more than that of the truncheon thing! london can
 | ring with hope and love. we can take the first step towards creating the
 | world we want.
 | 
 | 	matt> There will (it looks pretty certain) be a large event
 | 	matt> within the next three weeks in London which will
 | 	matt> (hopefully) be similar to the event that happened in
 | 	matt> San Francisco....roving groups of people stopping
 | 	matt> business as usual, along with people blocking key
 | 	matt> intersections to shut down the city.
 | 
 | why hopefully? sf was a disaster.
 | 
 | the actions in san francisco have been counter-productive. it:
 | 
 |   a) as chris says, polarised both activist+public opinion.
 | 
 |   b) gave the polcie (SFPD) a good excuse to use rather draconian
 |      measures. (in related news, didn't a police van drive over a
 |      protestor in washington dc?)
 | 
 |   c) annoyed enough of the public so that many actually support the
 |      SFPD "peace forces" in clearing out the "troublesome protestors".
 | 
 |   d) instilled paranoia and fear into many protestors. trust has
 |      started to break down for fear of infiltration. and some are
 |      afraid of doing any form of direct action for fear of their
 |      lives.
 | 
 |   e) has started to splinter a movement into militant and non-militant
 |      factions. seeing the horrors has made some people more militant.
 |      but at the same time, the moderates are shying away. and without
 |      strength in numbers, any action will get stamped down very quickly.
 | 
 | we need the majority of people to stand up and support us. we should be
 | the people. not some "enlightened" minority.
 | 
 | 	matt> I am well aware that this will not perform an educative
 | 	matt> function, but I think something like this is needed to
 | 	matt> hammer the point home that people will not stand for being
 | 	matt> screwed. If not now, when, if not us, then who?
 | 
 | i am tired of seeing some trying to make martyrs of themselves. what
 | does blocking roads, and bridges and intersections achieve by itself?
 | what does chanting against the police achieve by itself?
 | 
 | notice how words like "anarchists", "hackers", etc. are constantly
 | misrepresented? notice how these forces are the ones that actually
 | provide some form of real alternative, and thus a real threat?
 | 
 | the point here is that the "establishment" would use any excuse to
 | misrepresent all actions. and escalated direct action with no dialogue
 | would only serve in their interests. gives them an excuse to represent
 | _all_ the "remaining" protestors as extremist troublemakers.
 | 
 | and, is it me, or do people seriously underestimate the might of the
 | armed forces? as it stands, there is no hope for reclaiming the bases.
 | all it does is provides an excuse for the militant faction of the
 | movement to be labelled as "terrorists who pose a threat to national
 | security".
 | 
 | reclaiming the bases, if it's to be done, has to be done from the
 | inside. with members of the armed forces refusing to refuel the bombers.
 | with dockers refusing to load arms shipments. with loved ones of
 | soldiers writing in to them to give them support to stand up against
 | their superiors.
 | 
 | by chanting outside bases, all we do is cultivate an "us" and "them"
 | mentality. so instead, let's:
 | 
 |   1) listen to each other. listen and learn. let's have a war on
 |      ignorance.
 | 
 |   2) empower ourselves with dialogue and try to come up with
 |      solutions. it's easy to shout *NO* to things. but, without
 |      providing alternatives, the shouting is meaningless.
 | 
 |   3) celebrate life. this *is* your life, and it *is* ending one
 |      minute at a time. enjoy it. end the solitude. choose life.
 | 
 | 	giles> the problem with direct action is that most of the
 | 	giles> public think, whether right or not, that its just
 | 	giles> of bunch of thugs/peaceniks/hippies/wasters etc..
 | 	giles> and will therefore never listen to what they are
 | 	giles> saying although they may actually find they agree
 | 	giles> with it if they took notice.
 | 
 | *nod* we need to cater for everyone.
 | 
 | 	giles> the answer isnt becoming more extreme but playing
 | 	giles> them at their own game and although it seems slower
 | 	giles> you cant change people's opinions overnight. i you
 | 	giles> act in a way that the media/politicians/public can
 | 	giles> find fault with then it'll make a much stronger
 | 	giles> point.
 | 
 | (surely you meant can't?)
 | 
 | in either case, i both agree and disagree. i agree that we should not be
 | extremist. at the same time, we must make a strong statement.
 | 
 | blocking off central london is, in my book, a strong statement. yet, the
 | idea of dialogue is about toning down from extremist direct action and
 | instead focussing on education and empowerment.
 | 
 | i think we have a good balance here.
 | 
 | help me. i am just one person. i can't do this alone. but together,
 | anything is possible.
