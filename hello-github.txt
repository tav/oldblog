Hello GitHub!

I've completed the switch over to the `Git <http://www.git-scm.org>`_ version
control system. You can follow my activities on:

* http://github.com/tav

If you want to ever work on a project of mine, just click the fork button on
GitHub and start coding -- no need to get permission from me! Just let me know
if you want to get your changes back into the mainline.

GitHub even lets you edit forks directly from the website without having to
check out the repository. How cool is that?!

Now, for the Totally Pointless Awards, I created a colourful homepage using the
really nice GitHub pages mechanism:

* http://tav.github.com

And, finally, I have something of potential use for others using GitHub:
``gitbot.py`` uses the GitHub API to inform IRC channel(s) of commits to GitHub
repositories.

I ended up creating my own one because the default GitHub IRC notifier is rather
noisy and joins/leaves too much. You can find the code for the bot along with a
sample ``gitbotconfig.py`` file here:

Enjoy!
