`Dhaka <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka>`_ has a distinctive aroma. I had
expected it to smell like Mumbai or perhaps even Chennai. But it seems that
whilst there's quite an overlap, these South Asian mega-cities have their own
unique identities after all.

Advertisements for mobile phones and phone networks are *everywhere*. It wasn't
even a decade ago when these advertisements would have been for "cool drinks"
like Pepsi and Coca-Cola. But times change.

It's raining. Fly a few thousand miles and it's still raining. Perhaps one of us
is like the Rain Man in the 4th HHGTTG book?

The people are smiling. Always a good sign. The traffic slows to a standstill.
Time to soak in the noise. Poverty all around. Billboards for Grameen companies
everywhere. Wonder what this city looked like 50 years ago?
