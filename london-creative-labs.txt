I am pleased to announce the launch of `London Creative Labs
<http://londoncreativelabs.com/>`_! Check out the short video below on its first
program, which ties together systemic change along with a sort of `Y Combinator
<http://ycombinator.com/>`_ for `Social Business

It's also one of those moments when you are super super proud of your
girlfriend! `Sofia <http://sofiabustamante.com/>`_, the founder of London
Creative Labs, is an amazing systems thinker with a deep focus on "soft"
technologies.

However, until now, she has rarely shared her vision in a way that's accessible
for most people. But with London Creative Labs, not only has she setup a very
cool project, but the communications about it are brilliant!

I'm very proud of my sexy girl.
