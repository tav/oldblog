====================================
A Challenge To Break Python Security
====================================

:X-Created: [2009-02-23, 22:12]

The challenge is simple:

* Open a fresh Python interpreter and do:

    >>> from safelite import FileReader

* You can use ``FileReader`` to read files on your filesystem

* Now find a way to *write* to the filesystem from your interpreter

You can find the latest version of safelite.py here:

* http://release.plexnet.org/misc/cappython/safelite.py

I will keep safelite.py updated as new exploits and workarounds are found until
we hopefully end up with a version we can be confident about.

**Exploits Found & Fixed So Far:**

* `Victor Stinner <http://www.haypocalc.com/wiki/Victor_Stinner>`_ and `Tim
  Wintle
  <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2009-February/530536.html>`_
  found the first exploit: 

    >>> reload(__builtins__)
    <module '__builtin__' (built-in)> 

    >>> open('0wn3d', 'w').write('w00t\n')

If enough smart hackers look at this and it holds up, `Guido
<http://twitter.com/gvanrossum>`_ promises to accept a patch which would enable
this function-based approach to security on both App Engine and future Python
versions.

So, please try the challenge and let me know how you find it in the comments.
Thanks!

Note: The aim of this isn't to protect Python against crashes/segfaults or
exhaustion of resources attacks, so those don't count.

Good luck and thanks! =)
