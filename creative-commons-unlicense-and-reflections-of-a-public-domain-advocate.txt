I posted the following to the `Unlicense Google Group
<http://groups.google.com/group/unlicense>`_ earlier today and figured
that some of you might be interested in the proposed Creative Commons
Unlicense.

  | Hi Arto, Mike et al.
  |
  | First of all, congrats for coming up with the term "Unlicense". It's
  | genius! As someone who has been placing all of his work into the
  | public domain for most of the last decade, I am very thankful that
  | there is finally a concrete movement emerging around unlicensing.
  |
  | Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to share my journey into the
  | world of public domain and gradually build up to a proposal of a
  | "Creative Commons Unlicense".

  | **Reflections of a Public Domain Advocate**
  |
  | They got me before I'd even hit puberty. The UK Intellectual Property
  | Office that is. At school they handed out leaflets on Copyright,
  | Trademarks and Patents. I was mesmerised. Having already written 2
  | books on music and working on various inventions, it was truly
  | empowering to know that the law would protect my rights as a creator.
  |
  | Being able to dictate how your work is used. Being able to make money
  | from the royalties generated by your work. Being able to prevent
  | others from abusing your work for their own profit. It made perfect
  | sense. It appealed to that primal desire for being in control.
  |
  | I was so in love with intellectual property that even my school notes
  | had a copyright statement at the bottom of each page. This continued
  | all the way till I was 17 when I started my first company. Being a
  | tech startup in 1999, it wasn't too long before an inevitable
  | encounter with the open source movement.
  |
  | As you can imagine, this was quite an experience. In fact, it's really
  | nice to see some familiar faces from those times on this list: Mike
  | Linksvayer (from Bitzi days) and Peter Saint-Andre (from the early
  | Jabber days).
  |
  | It took a few months, but by the time 2000 began, I was convinced of
  | the merits of open source. The copyleft nature of the GPL assuaged my
  | fears of having my work exploited by others. And the success of
  | projects like Linux and companies like VA Linux Systems served as
  | tangible proof that sharing worked.
  |
  | And so I became one of those annoying free software fanatics. I am
  | sorry to say that I wasted countless hours arguing on various internet
  | forums about the merits of the GPL versus other licenses. But, on the
  | flip side, I did acquire various proprietary initiatives and release
  | them as free software.
  |
  | In any case, it was an uphill struggle convincing investors of the
  | merits of open source. It simply did not make sense to them. Many
  | refused to invest for that reason alone. And, all the while, I kept to
  | my belief that a billion-dollar industry was possible by enabling
  | creators to make money from sharing their works openly.
  |
  | And then finally, in either late 2001 or early 2002, one of my
  | friends, Tavin Cole, decided to spend an entire day of his life
  | questioning my stance on the GPL. To this day I am extremely grateful
  | for his effort — he enlightened me on the merits of the public domain.
  |
  | In essence, his argument revolved around the fact that copyleft is
  | merely an act of control and true freedom would be to enable people to
  | do whatever they pleased with your work. He correctly identified fear
  | as being a prime motivator behind my love affair with the GPL and that
  | life would be a lot more pleasant without being gripped by it.
  |
  | With my belief in the GPL shaken, I started experimenting with the
  | public domain. Python hackers seemed to public domain their work with
  | a single line, so I adopted a similar practice and added a minimal
  | header of the format:

  ::

       # Released into the Public Domain by tav <tav@espians.com>

  |
  | This worked out quite well until 2004 when I moved to Berlin for a
  | year. Here I came across various German hackers who argued that it was
  | impossible to place works into the public domain due to the
  | consideration of moral rights under German law.
  |
  | I experimented with various structures to try and resolve this issue,
  | e.g. contracts between the individuals and a company based in the UK
  | which would then release the intellectual property into the public
  | domain, etc. But nothing was really satisfactory until Creative
  | Commons released the CC0 license.
  |
  | It cleverly combined the public domain dedication with a fallback
  | public license for jurisdictions where one can't fully public domain
  | one's work. Not understanding why CC0 can't be used for code, I
  | adopted the license with enthusiasm and remixed it with a grant of
  | patent rights to create a Public Domain License which I've been using
  | for all my work — writing, code, designs, etc.
  |
  | **Creative Commons Unlicense**
  |
  | As you can imagine, it sounded silly to be public domain-ing work
  | under the Public Domain *License* — but it seemed good enough.
  | However, once I heard about "Unlicense", I was smitten by its
  | awesomeness and have already migrated a few projects, e.g.
  |
  | * https://github.com/tav/ampify
  | * https://github.com/tav/git-review
  |
  | Now, whilst I've adopted the term wholesale, the text on `unlicense.org`_
  | doesn't address a number of concerns:
  |
  | * It is limited to just code. Software projects also tend to have
  |   documentation, schemas, graphics, etc. It would be nice if the
  |   unlicense covered all of these.
  |
  | * It doesn't address moral rights in any way.
  |
  | * It doesn't address patent rights in any way. This becomes even more
  |   relevant when you're receiving patches from organisations who might
  |   hold relevant patents.
  |
  | * It doesn't provide advice on how to refer to the unlicense within
  |   individual files. I've taken to having the following minimal header
  |   instead of copying the entire text into every file:

  ::

      # Public Domain (-) 2010-2011 The Ampify Authors.
      # See the Ampify UNLICENSE file for details.

  |
  | * It doesn't address third party code. Putting an UNLICENSE file in
  |   the root of the repository without such consideration suggests that
  |   all the code files are in the public domain — which may not be true.
  |
  | In an ideal world, we'd all come together and build on CC0 and the
  | Unlicense to create a *Creative Commons Unlicense* which addresses all
  | of these concerns. I am not sure if this would be of interest to
  | anyone else, but it is of interest to me.
  |
  | I've had a go at remixing the various texts into a new Unlicense:
  |
  | * http://ampify.it/unlicense.html
  |
  | Here is the raw text, including the accompanying authors file:
  |
  | * https://github.com/tav/ampify/blob/master/UNLICENSE
  | * https://github.com/tav/ampify/blob/master/AUTHORS
  |
  | Now I am not a lawyer and the text needs work, but I hope it's a good
  | starting point — or, at the very least, provides some idea of what I'm
  | getting at.
  |
  | Is this of interest to any of you? Could we come together to manifest
  | a Creative Commons Unlicense?
  |
  | Please do let me know what you think.
