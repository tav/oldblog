*[This is a reposting of an email that I had sent to the Hub London list on
February 29th of this year.]*

 | Another interesting development.
 | 
 | Whilst all approaches to improving the signal-to-noise ratio is
 | very welcome, is this really the right approach? Sure, all those
 | mails asking about missing chargers clog up our inboxes. But as
 | someone who has had a few of his phone chargers (not to mention
 | a laptop!) going walkies from the Hub, I can certainly emphatise.
 | 
 | I'd contest that all the frivolous "noisy" mails are essential
 | for the continuity of the community. Otherwise, this is just yet
 | another information channel and we already have more than enough
 | of those. The reason most people are on here is probably because
 | of the quality of the other people on here. I certainly am here
 | because it gives me a feeling of the pulse of my Hub family. The
 | personal connection. If I wanted impersonal high quality
 | information, I'd just go and google. Millions of strangers.

.. more
 |
 | So if it's the personal connections that brings us here, then
 | surely we have to deal with the noise from time to time? Because
 | it's that which lubricates and keeps the list alive.
 | 
 | I have found 3 things which help form great communities.
 | 
 | * The engaged wise who provide something of value
 | * The noisy young who give it character and act as a binding agent
 | * The ease of which someone can transition between active/dormant
 | 
 | And all attempts that I've seen which have tried to separate any
 | of those have led to poorer communities.
 | 
 | Anyways, just my two cents. Anyone have any further thoughts?
 | 
 | On a side note, do we have any Hubs opening up by the sea? As I
 | sit here overlooking the ocean, I can't but feel truly connected
 | to the world as a whole. It's euphoric. Whilst they might drown
 | if the sea level ever rises, it'd be a worthy investment just
 | for the pure pleasure it provides in the now.
