=========================
Meme Time Tending to Zero
=========================

It's no secret that Meme Time -- the average time taken for a `meme
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme>`_ to spread far and wide -- has been getting
shorter. Scarily so. It took Christianity over a 1,000 years to achieve what
Facebook has done in less than 4 years.

This thought-provoking video is worth watching:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="center">
  <object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jpEnFwiqdx8&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jpEnFwiqdx8&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
  </div>

It reinforces the words of `Mamading Ceesay <http://twitter.com/evangineer>`_:
"The whole world is going to be experiencing environmentally-induced `ADHD
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder>`_ pretty
soon".

Which leads me to worry about the social implications of this increasing pace.
Being able to overcome information overload and limiting your attention to what
really matters to you is going to be absolutely vital in the future.

But if we are going to prepare for that, we also need to know the rate of the
current flow. How long does it take for a meme to become a part of daily life
for a population of 10 million people? How long does it take for a meme to be
known by 100 million people?

By knowing these and other related data points to "Meme Time", we would be
better placed to adapt. Maybe we are heading towards `The Singularity
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity>`_ after all?

Would it be possible to start gathering enough statistics to get a relatively
accurate picture? How could we do this so that it brings the greatest benefits
to everyone? How would we handle the privacy issues?

As usual, let me know your thoughts in the comments. Thanks!
