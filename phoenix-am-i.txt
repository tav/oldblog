 | /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 | 
 |   1. realisations and hard lessons learnt.
 | 
 |   2. my plans for the coming 6 months.
 | 
 | /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 |

 | #
 | / lessons learnt
 | #
 | \
 | 
 | i have woken up from the funk that i entered back in april.
 | 
 | this has, without doubt, been the quietest period of my life. i achieved
 | fuck all.
 | 
 | my apologies also for not really talking and keeping in contact much.
 | whereas usually i do that because i am caught up in something exciting,
 | and forgotten to even eat, the last few months have just been shit.
 | 
 | anyways, i recently got one of my moments of extreme clarity. when
 | everything came together in perfect harmony. the last time this happened
 | was when i was 16, and resulted in a lot of fun things, like esp =)
 | 
 | this moment of clarity has served to put my basics back in sync, taking
 | into account the experiences i have had and lessons "learnt".
 | 
 | and, although it's probably just common sense to most of you, i thought
 | i would share some of my realisations, thoughts and decisions.
 | 
 | #
 | / small steps matter
 | #
 | 
 | i have always been too fixated on leaps and bounds and have hated small
 | steps. this was made even more acute by my will-be-dead-at-27 thing. but
 | i have come to realise that without taking small steps, you just won't
 | get anywhere.
 | 
 | the problem though is that i have always been afraid of getting stuck in
 | a small step. just look around at all the shit jobs people do and
 | meaningless lives they lead...
 | 
 | but the solution is pretty simple. you just have to *simultaneously*
 | focus on small steps _and_ the giant leaps. and, in the end, it is from
 | the small things that the big things grow.
 | 
 | #
 | / large ego bad
 | #
 | 
 | my ego has always been a source of amusing contradiction for me. on the
 | one hand, i am a relatively selfless individual. but, yet, i am
 | extremely self orientated.
 | 
 | and, recently, it not only bordered on arrogance, but was arrogant.
 | 
 | but, even worse, my ego was damaging my work to unite the world. at
 | times, i became over-protective of my ideas. but, that was just plain
 | stupid. not to mention hypocritical for someone who doesn't believe in
 | ownership.
 | 
 | so, to be effective, i have to let go of my ego and work with others and
 | treat them as the equals that they are.
 | 
 | this, in turn has affected my plans substantially.
 | 
 | for example, instead of creating one large organisation which will be
 | the transformative, transindustrial, transnational which will lay the
 | way for uniting the world, i have decided to instead focus my energies
 | on creating an ecology within which multitudes of organisations can
 | flourish and co-operate effectively.
 | 
 | #
 | / large ego good
 | #
 | 
 | my ego is also one of my strong points. it gives me the balls to do what
 | i do, bolsters my confidence and renews my belief in my vision, which in
 | turn fuels my optimism and gives me boundless energy.
 | 
 | the trick is to use it appropriately. especially in relation with my
 | charisma.
 | 
 | unfortunately, like with ejaculation and orgasm, i had mistakenly
 | thought the two came together. but, this isn't so. one can be
 | charismatic without an overpowering ego, and yet be fueled by the ego.
 | 
 | unfortunately, i haven't really had much chance to put this into
 | practise yet, but now that i have realised it, should be easier to do so.
 | 
 | #
 | / like ego, like perfectionism
 | #
 | 
 | perfectionism can be a wonderful ally. i expect it from myself and
 | others in the work they do for me. however, it can also be a real
 | barrier. instead of simply getting something out, i try to create
 | systems that accomodate all possible eventualities.
 | 
 | but, when you consider the 20/80 rule (20% effort == 80% output), and
 | take into consideration the most precious commodity we all have, time,
 | being a perfectionist seems to be neither wise nor advantageous.
 | 
 | i have no idea how i am going to overcome this little problem, but if i
 | am to achieve everything that i intend to, then it must be done.
 | 
 | #
 | / the importance of completion
 | #
 | 
 | one of the drawbacks of enjoying hypomania is that i am easily
 | distracted. new ideas. new thoughts. oooh, shiny thing!
 | 
 | add that to my perfectionism, and i can end up in a state of starting
 | multitudes of things, but never completing them. i need to bear some
 | self discipline in mind. need to ensure that the task at hand is
 | completed before moving onto another.
 | 
 | but, this is easily solvable. see, i am amazing at goal-drected
 | activities (and this is in fact another benefits of hypomania i am
 | told). so, all i need to do is to write and maintain todo lists!
 | 
 | #
 | / a self note
 | #
 | 
 | be more aware.
 | 
 |               be more aware.
 | 
 |                             be more aware.
 | 
 | #
 | / the journey is the destination
 | #
 | 
 | although i think i follow this more than most people, i need to remember
 | it more.
 | 
 | also, combined with sustainability, i have decided to live out my
 | childhood fantasy of doing every job possible. so, i am going to look
 | for all sorts of part-time jobs. from being a cook, to a gardener, to a
 | builder, to a teacher, to an electrician, to a barman, to ...
 | 
 | the aim with these jobs isn't to make much money, or to find a long term
 | career in them, but to broaden my life in general with people,
 | experience and knowledge.
 | 
 | and, in money terms, these jobs will make me sustainable with regards to
 | my basic needs. for a few days work a week, i could make enough to pay
 | any bills, repay some of my debt, and afford good food, clothing and
 | transport.
 | 
 | i am tired of living on the poverty line. living on a few quid a week
 | gets real tiring after the twentieth time.
 | 
 | also, sustainability means no need to be a burden on others whilst i
 | work on more ambitious projects.
 | 
 | #
 | / this is my life and it is ending one minute at a time
 | #
 | 
 | like the "journey is the destination" maxim, this is another that i have
 | lived by for a long time now. but, again, i need to remember it more.
 | 
 | too much time wasted in idling about and not enough in doing the work or
 | having real fun. life is too short to simply think/talk about ideas. i
 | should write things down, and wherever possible, actually implement
 | them, or at least, get the ball rolling so that others can do so.
 | 
 | i have also often found life to be a hell of a lot more fun when i keep
 | this in mind constantly.
 | 
 | #
 | / integrity matters
 | #
 | 
 | somewhere along the way, i lost touch with integrity. not that i was
 | intentionally trying to trick people and be immoral. but, my morals got
 | perverted by my long-term logic.
 | 
 | e.g. "it doesn't matter that i had told this person that i would repay
 | them by this date, because i will simply make lots and lots of money in
 | the future, and repay them back tenfold."
 | 
 | too many promises broken. my word has been meaningless, as i was willing
 | to compromise it based on my long term aims. too many loved ones hurt.
 | 
 | so, from this point onwards, i vow to conform reality to my words, i.e.
 | keep my promises and fulfill expectations, and do my best to fulfill
 | previously given promises.
 | 
 | i want to nurture a world full of love, and if i cannot keep my
 | commitments and promises, then there is no reason for people to trust.
 | and without trust, there is no love.
 | 
 | also, i had been breaking expectations i had set myself. justifying to
 | myself changes and modifications to my plans. "it doesn't matter if i
 | don't complete this now, as once i have done this other thing, then this
 | would have been solved."
 | 
 | if i am to get anywhere in uniting the world, then my word has to be
 | stronger than oak. especially to myself.
 | 
 | \
 | #
 | / a summary of the coming months
 | #
 | \
 | 
 | so, in order to see how well i conform reality to my words and to write
 | a nice todo list for myself, i am going to lay out my general plans for
 | the next 6 months, and see how well i do.
 | 
 | so, in no particular order, we have:
 | 
 | * sort out current situation. tie up all loose ends so that i can
 |   gradually become a complete and sustainable nomad sometime during
 |   the period.
 | 
 | * setup a proper riva (live/work space) at efpee (finsbury park), and
 |   gradually expand the various other locations into fully fledged rivas.
 | 
 | * get part-time jobs of varying nature (cook / cleaner / gardener /
 |   salesman / barman / stripper / tailor / mason / etc.) to pay the bills
 |   and expand boundaries of knowledge and enrich life.
 | 
 | * form a collective, with those willing and close, to experiment with
 |   the various economic models, especially eco-economics (i.e. taking
 |   ecological footprint into account), to provide for each other's basic
 |   socio-economic needs.
 | 
 | * finish developing xnet 1.0. this will provide the necessary groupware
 |   communications, knowledge, content, commerce and project management
 |   infrastructure for future. setup a few sites to demonstrate the tech.
 | 
 | * see friends that i haven't seen in ages. see if any of my lovers still
 |   love me. (my love is eternal, but to many, absence in love is often
 |   like water upon fire, a little quickens but much extinguishes).
 | 
 | * get the consultancy (opn tech? via3?) going so that it promotes the
 |   toman (my open organisation) model and brings in revenue by selling
 |   expertise on the various developed tech, e.g. xnet, kalati, etc.
 | 
 | * perhaps also join via3 as a technical director and transform it into
 |   the global intelligence unit for the third sector that it would like
 |   to be and develop the tech needed to enable a green barter network.
 | 
 | * work on building up the uniteddiversity lifestyle brand in general.
 |   ensure that book selling, nites promotion and ud communication hub
 |   have effective infrastructure. sort out ecogoods delivery to members.
 | 
 | * get body and mind back into gear: eating regularly; exercising;
 |   cleansing; sleep depriving again; meditating; practising multiple
 |   awareness, memory, neural reprogramming, lucid dreaming, etc.
 | 
 | * start reading books again. haven't done this properly in over a
 |   decade. use the knowledge management features of the xnet to maintain
 |   and grow an effective knowledge base. (do same with music/movies).
 | 
 | /
 | 
 | * code and release plex 0.1 (a decentralised network with built-in
 |   indexing, event routers, and trust-matrix based identities). get
 |   certain espians working on it and heading towards 0.2 with a better
 |   networking layer and a working distributed, component-based
 |   application framework (kalati).
 | 
 | * step up on the war on ignorance. ensure that it is being effective,
 |   and start out by creating bookshare systems and simple alternative
 |   media infrastructure.
 | 
 | * learn languages again. work on elocution wrt english/tamil. practise
 |   what little french/hindi i know. and, start properly learning at least
 |   one of: spanish, arabic, russian, norwegian, greek, japanese.
 | 
 | * put espmantra into place. get a small team working on building up a
 |   global profile. in keeping with the maxim of 'perception is
 |   everything', a global image should be promoted through publications.
 | 
 | * create a new business organisation to handle the sms and plex-based
 |   reputation service with the venue and events registration/management
 |   service. raise capital by selling franchises and traditional equity.
 |   use some of this to "buy out" the shareholders of esp of old.
 | 
 | * head out to kristiansand, norway. play with the big girl and the
 |   rabbit. work on getting my amazing norwegian espian back working on
 |   cool stuff again. visit the zoo.
 | 
 | * interact and get involved with other groups and organisations again.
 |   perhaps start off by renewing connections with the capitalist
 |   and anarchist groups in kristiansand and giving them better tools.
 | 
 | * go be a hippy and promote the uniteddiversity essence at the big green
 |   gathering. (july 29 - august 3).
 | 
 | * write and publish the "seed" + rehimsa document/book. this should
 |   coincide with the release of plex 0.2. release both initially to the
 |   'friends of tav' mailing list and post-feedback, promote it elsewhere.
 | 
 | * lay foundations for the organisations and projects put forward in the
 |   "seed" document. chief amongst these is to revive esp and fundraise
 |   for it by placing the plex on the "gift market".
 | 
 | * start repaying debt to friends in installments with the aim of all
 |   personal debt to friends being cleared by the end of the 6 month
 |   period.
 | 
 | /
 | 
 | * become a technologically enabled sustainable nomad. on average, spend:
 | 
 |   - about a quarter of time learning (e.g. reading, listening, doing);
 | 
 |   - another quarter working (e.g. writing, coding, building, composing)
 |     on the various ideas and organisations;
 | 
 |   - another quarter with others (e.g. talking, listening, dancing,
 |     travelling, co-ordinating, negotiating);
 | 
 |   - and, the final quarter on life essentials (e.g. eating, sleeping,
 |     loving).
 | 
 |   spread the essence of unity and love the world over.
 | 
 | * work on the "instrument" (for those who don't know, this is a new
 |   musical instrument that i intend to create. imagine air guitar making
 |   actual sounds meeting hi-tech meeting dj'ing meeting manic dancing ;p)
 | 
 | * explore wearable computing (perhaps get involved in the mithril
 |   project). see if i can minimise the load of always-on technological
 |   capability so that it's comfortable to carry about, and yet, be
 |   effective at providing a powerful tool at all times.
 | 
 | * go be a hacker/activist/artist at the chaos communication camp in
 |   berlin, germany.
 | 
 |   whilst there, take care of other things too. in particular, spend a
 |   bit of time working on "the touch society" regarding the importance of
 |   touch. (august 8-11).
 | 
 | * perhaps travel (train?) down to greece. hook up with relevant people,
 |   organisations and communities as usual. and, depending on how i feel
 |   about a certain someone, meet up with her. (august 12-14)?
 | 
 | * head out to west coast usa. start out by dropping in san francisco for
 |   a few days, and then get down to los angeles to meet up with some
 |   of the infoanarchy kru and work on the playainfo trailer/installation.
 |   hopefully also organise a mini-meetup of all american espians.
 | 
 |   once done, road trip to weather the dust storms at burning man. there:
 |   spread the word of the multicultural yoghurt party; deploy wireless
 |   infrastructure; host chats around the round table of democracy;
 |   facilitate/engage in a barter economy; and, perhaps do a debut
 |   performance on the "instrument". (mid august - early september).
 | 
 | /
 | 
 | * finish off the west coast adventure by getting the hell out of
 |   civilisation for another week by chilling out with the underground up
 |   in british columbia, canada. go hiking, visit hotsprings, chat about
 |   gift economies. (first week of september).
 | 
 | * bring together the relevant people and organisations to start up cge
 |   (citizens of the gift economy).
 | 
 | * get the "stop listening to the lies" campaign going in full swing down
 |   in london. setup effective infrastructure for alternative mass media.
 |   (hopefully the espian waveband project would have matured by then).
 | 
 | * direct energies towards the "sustainable london" project.
 | 
 | * setup local "resource centres" in london and as in many other places
 |   as possible. amongst other things, these should:
 | 
 |   - bring together local communities.
 | 
 |   - house infrastructure.
 | 
 |   - provides effective and sustainable decentralised distribution
 |     mechanism to facilitate trade/plexchange.
 | 
 | * create plex+smart card based alternative currency and identity
 |   systems. tie it together with the local resource centres and get
 |   individuals and businesses from all over involved and using it.
 | 
 | * utilise the created infrastructure to bring together cultural and
 |   commercial aspects of the tamil diaspora. form organisations /
 |   corporations based upon this.
 | 
 | * help sellatel get established in the telecommunications industry.
 |   in particular, work on creating and launching the dial and talk
 |   service leading to community networks and voip.
 | 
 | * start local "open space" meetings in finsbury park. get the community
 |   to come together in all sorts of ways. an ecclesia in the pit in
 |   finsbury park. discuss issues, flirt, dance into the nite. local wtf.
 | 
 | * attend and perform at this year's sex maniac's "pastoral" ball. a
 |   lord? a shepherd? a unicorn? (september 20-21).
 | 
 | * get "prime scholar" going. linked in with the local "resource
 |   centres", this would provide better and more useful forms of
 |   teaching and learning.
 | 
 | /
 | 
 | * organise esp0rgy. a fortnight of intense development on the plex and
 |   other espian projects (e.g. espra), with the aim of releasing a beta
 |   version of the plex at the end of it. possibly in london / istanbul /
 |   toronto? (late september - early october).
 | 
 | * bring together interesting and relevant groups (from all the various
 |   worlds: business, political, environmental, media, artistic,
 |   economical, technological, etc.) from around the world for the first
 |   wtfcon in toronto, canada. (first week of october).
 | 
 |   besides being a place to demonstrate the efforts of espians and the
 |   other organisations working in and with the toman ecology, wtfcon
 |   should serve as a gathering of the vanguard of "the root" movement.
 | 
 |   promote the proliferation of local wtfs to discuss and tackle various
 |   relevant issues all over the world.
 | 
 | * bring together talented artists (music/theatre/comedy/etc.) to
 |   build up awareness and highlight the problems (especially the food/air
 |   deal) the world faces and potential solutions to them.
 | 
 | * go to one of the future heartlands of espia (kerala, india) and scope
 |   it out, especially in terms of building a city there.
 | 
 |   kerala also happens to be not too far from coimbatoire where a certain
 |   someone is doing her mba =) hopefully, she will be free to travel
 |   around places.
 | 
 |   whilst in india, also make preparations regarding the organisation of
 |   the world social forum in january of next year, and perhaps also
 |   travel to other regions, e.g. gujarat. (mid-late october).
 | 
 | * promote relevant ideas at the da vinci institute's future of money
 |   summit in colorado, usa, e.g: pecus (plex economic currency units);
 |   gift, reputation and eco-economics; global reference currencies;
 |   micropayments; automated bartering; and, better organisational models
 |   such as toman. (october 27-29).
 | 
 | * perhaps get involved in setting up a business to business marketplace
 |   in the cote d'ivore for all that cocoa! provide the producers with
 |   both soft and hard infrastructure.
 | 
 | /
 | 
 | * direct esp's energies into creating the plex based automated
 |   multi-party bartering network which ties into reputation branding and
 |   trust based producers and consumers and, of course, the toman ecology.
 | 
 | * spend some dedicated time promoting the plex on the gift market;
 |   become a "darling" of the mainstream media; focus a lot of energies on
 |   business development.
 | 
 | * co-ordinate pedipeace. preparations for this should have started right
 |   after wtfcon. let peace, love and harmony ring in cities all over as
 |   we engage the democracy at crossroads. (early november).
 | 
 | * help organise and attend the european social forum in paris/st dennis,
 |   france. listen to what everyone is saying, and try and help everyone
 |   work together better. (november 12-16).
 | 
 | * perhaps check out the interesting things happening in south america,
 |   especially in argentina and brazil. if possible, try and live there
 |   for a few weeks. (mid november - mid december)?
 | 
 | * join the world future council and help them become more effective in
 |   creating a viable alternative to the undemocratic united nations and
 |   become a true voice of humanity.
 | 
 | * work towards enhancing the status of women the world over. research
 |   into and explore matriarchal societies.
 | 
 | * start off a system of voluntary subscription to a one-child policy.
 |   experiment with the idea and create a marketplace where child rights
 |   can be exchanged.
 | 
 | * establish intellectual property to be a fallacy, and build up
 |   awareness of the various organisations, e.g. riaa, wipo, which are
 |   hampering social evolution in selfish short-sightedness.
 | 
 | * help create the book of money as an evolving publication/art. write a
 |   piece on the various economic models for it, e.g. pecus, etc.
 | 
 | * work a bit on writing the science-fiction novel 'under the shadows of
 |   the simura' whenever inspiration strikes. likewise with 'the smiling
 |   ones'.
 | 
 | * perhaps visit sri lanka to scope out the viability of building a
 |   city there.
 | 
 | /
 | 
 | * attend the world summit on the information society (wsis) in geneva
 |   (switzerland) and get involved in the united nations effort to close
 |   the digital divide. (december 10-12).
 | 
 |   promote creating renewable-energy powered, wireless mesh-networked,
 |   open source operating system and plex enhanced aierus (artificial
 |   intelligence enhanced resource units). perhaps also get involved
 |   beforehand in the preparatory committee meeting for wsis, prepcom-3,
 |   also in geneva. (september 15-26).
 | 
 |   and, if, there is enough momentum for it to materialise, help organise
 |   and attend the world forum on communication rights.
 | 
 | * have another session of esp0rgy in either london/istanbul with the
 |   intention of releasing a near final version (0.9?) of the plex by the
 |   end of it. (mid-late december)
 | 
 | * party! get everyone i love (especially the wasp kru, espians, and
 |   udites) for a new year's party that crosses national boundaries.
 |   perhaps also tie it in with a big int'l uniteddiversity nite/party.
 | 
 | * head over to india again and work on the preparations for the world
 |   social forum in mumbai. provide technological infrastructure to all.
 |   get everyone to focus on the solutions rather than on the problems.
 |   (january 16-21).
 | 
 | * form a political "party" that reflects the toman ecology, the real
 |   biosphere and values of direct democracy balancing the global with the
 |   local and the needs of the majority with that of the minority.
 | 
 |   create a common framework for the various commons (land and labour)
 |   that are being formed/nurtured, to interoperate, so that eventually,
 |   when a global vote can take place on the governing of it, there can
 |   be a smooth transition.
 | 
 | * train more guardians. tie that in with putting together and growing
 |   teams that can create temporary cities rapidly and effectively. the
 |   city builders.
 | 
 | * design architecture for the future that minimises ecological impact
 |   whilst maximising usage of technology and fosters an environment
 |   which serves to bring people together as opposed to keeping them
 |   segregated.
 | 
 | * perhaps (if i can get an invite) attend the world economic forum in
 |   davos, switzerland, in the role of ceo of esp. try and convince the
 |   various multinationals/nations to adopt the toman model and the
 |   related economic concepts. (january 21-25).
 | 
 | /
 | 
 | note: any statement tempered with a "perhaps", especially that last one,
 | is something that i either believe is not really possible given external
 | dependencies and/or time constraints.
 | 
 | but, as to the rest of the plan, although as a whole, it is without
 | doubt extremely ambitious, each item on the todo list is well within my
 | capabilities, and thus as long as i keep at it consistently, it should
 | all be realisable.
 | 
 | wish me luck, and help me stay on course!
