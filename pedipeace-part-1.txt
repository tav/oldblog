 | rehi,
 | 
 | i have often expressed my discontent of protest marches, petitions, and
 | the likes of direct action such as hunger strikes, sit-ins, blockades,
 | chaining oneself to..., etc.
 | 
 | i agree with all of them in theory, and in practise they all work great
 | as acts of solidarity. they bring people together. let people know that
 | they are not alone in their feelings.
 | 
 | however, unfortunately for us, their value has been diminished over the
 | years. the hippies did too good a job. values and beliefs and actions so
 | adapted by mainstream culture, that they have no effect.

.. more
 | 
 | so let's not merely walk from A to B. let's not block traffic and
 | achieve nothing besides annoying people and getting yourself nicked.
 | let's not chant mindlessly at the police -- these guys are just doing
 | their job, they've heard the fucking chants all day long.
 | 
 | it's time to take things a step further. time to do something
 | constructive. and so, i would like to propose the "pedipeace movement"
 | -- pedestrianise for peace.
 | 
 | let's choose one day, and on that day, not have cars travel through
 | london, and form circles at every other crossroads, and have a dialogue
 | about various issues.
 | 
 | it doesn't even have to all be a dialogue of words. at some crossroads,
 | we could have wonderful music and dance. at some crossroads, we could
 | have beautiful men and women giving out free food.
 | 
 | we could discuss nuclear disarmament at oxford circus, palestine at
 | cambridge circus. the idea is to have a circle at many crossroads and
 | people to come forward to the middle and express themselves. to have a
 | dialogue.
 | 
 | we should practise the law of two feet, which states simply that if you
 | find yourself in a situation where you are neither learning nor
 | contributing – use your two feet and move to some place more to you
 | liking. maybe to another crossroad, or maybe to a park somewhere. no
 | matter what, don’t sit there feeling miserable.
 | 
 | we could create some infrastructure to make this happen better. e.g.
 | let's say that people are discussing nuclear disarmament at oxford
 | circus. i go there and text a number (let's say 2661) "nuclear disarmament".
 | 
 | and then, when someone sends a second number (let's say 2662), asking
 | where people are discussing "nuclear disarmament", it would send back
 | directions to the one at oxford circus. you could add the numbers of
 | your friends to the system so that people could filter the results more
 | effectively...
 | 
 | so, in summary... we would have true dialogue. not some pompous git
 | standing up on stage lecturing us all, but instead dialogue between the
 | people. democracy. we would have achieved something constructuve. every
 | nite, people could go back and write up summaries of what happened...
 | 
 | we would have people talking to each other. we would have people
 | learning more about the land around them. their geography. we could have
 | wonderful street parties in the night, celebrating life.
 | 
 | we would be expressing our discontent by blocking off central london.
 | and, yet at the same time, we would be practising what we preach by
 | using cars less. we are all oil junkies. it's time to ease up on our
 | addiction.
 | 
 | many people are angry. many people feel betrayed. but, let's direct that
 | energy into achieving something constructive. into creating the world
 | that we want. let's not just chant mindlessly. let's come up with solutions.
 | 
 | i would appreciate everyone's thoughts and comments on this. criticism,
 | both positive and negative, is very welcome. i would like to give this a
 | serious push once we've got a solid plan in place.
