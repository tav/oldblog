Oneline: Constructive Conversations on Twitter
===============================================

`David Pinto <http://twitter.com/happyseaurchin>`_ had this wonderful insight
that the quality of conversations could go up dramatically if each participant
was limited to saying just one sentence at a time.

We practised this in face-to-face conversations and found it to be a great
success!

Paradoxically, limiting the "bandwidth" led to richer conversations. It
encouraged everyone to `truly listen <#oneline-listening>`_ to each other and kept issues on topic.

And, most importantly, it put everyone involved on an equal footing -- allowing
focus to be placed upon the content instead of whoever can dominate the room.

The application of this approach is extremely broad. From resolving personal
conflicts to working out the kinks in a new idea. Try the oneline approach on
Twitter and let me know how it works out for you.

**Oneline Rules:**

1. Only 2 people to a oneline dialogue.

2. You must @reply to keep the conversation going.

3. All tweets must end with ``#oneline``.

4. No more than one tweet at a time by each party.

5. It's over if neither party continues within 24 hours.

in the mood for a fight rather than a pleasant conversation.]
