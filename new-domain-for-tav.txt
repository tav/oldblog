==================
New Domain for Tav
==================

**Update:** I reverted to tav.espians.com as the main domain -- asktav.com
redirects here so you can use it as a shorter url to type...

My apologies to all those who have been following this blog through the RSS
feed. As some of you have noticed, the feed has been behaving rather erratically
recently.

This is because I have been migrating everything from pleinair.googlecode.com to
the new asktav.com domain. This is now the permanent home for my blog and will
remain so until the Plexnet eventually replaces the current domain name system.

.. more

The feed should be working properly again and is still at the same place as it
always was -- http://feeds.feedburner.com/asktav. I don't plan to move domains
anytime soon so you can expect a certain level of stability now =)

Unfortunately I wasn't able to migrate over the old comments to the new domain.
Disqus doesn't seem to have any builtin comment migration across domains
feature. So apologies if you look at an article and don't see your comments
turning up.

The comments are still there on the Disqus system -- just pointing to the wrong
URL. I'll try and see if I can leverage the `Disqus API
<http://disqus.com/docs/api/>`_ to somehow integrate the comments. I really
value all of your comments and hope that you understand.

As part of the migration, I also expanded the backend with some additional
features:

.. syntax:: console

  $ python -m plexnet.tool.article --help
  Usage: article.py [options]

  Options:
    -h, --help          show this help message and exit
    -a AUTHORS          Set the path for a special authors file (optional)
    -c PACKAGE          Generate documentation for the Python package (optional)
    -d DATA_FILE        Set the path for a persistent data file (optional)
    -e OUTPUT_ENCODING  Set the output encoding (default: utf-8)
    -f FORMAT           Set the output format (default: html)
    -i INPUT_ENCODING   Set the input encoding (default: utf-8)
    -o OUTPUT_PATH      Set the output directory for files (default: $PWD)
    -p PATTERN          Generate index files for the path pattern (optional)
    -r ROOT_PATH        Set the path to the root working directory (optional)
    -t TEMPLATE         Set the path to a template file (optional)
    --quiet             Flag to suppress output
    --stdout            Flag to redirect to stdout instead of to a file

It now supports multiple authors and even generates pretty source documentation
for Python packages, as can be seen on the the new domain for the Plexnet:
http://www.plexnet.org

The code is sitting a a new `source repository <https://svn.plexnet.org>`_ with
a pretty Rails-based Subversion browser called `Warehouse
<http://www.warehouseapp.com/>`_. You can see it @ http://source.plexnet.org.

Thanks for bearing with the upheaval. To make up for it, maybe you'll be
interested to know that some others have started blogging too:
