£10 from you will help fund my next project, `TweetPlex
<peer-fund-tweetplex-with-a-tenner#what-is-tweetplex>`_ -- a web-based Twitter
client to save people time and help them be more productive.

£10 will also get you one of 1,000 "shares" -- so feel free to be generous and
take several :)

So far £410 has been raised with the top givers being:

* `David Pinto <http://twitter.com/happyseaurchin>`_ (£400), `Sofia Bustamante
  <http://twitter.com/olasofia>`_ (£10)

**Why TweetPlex?**

`Twitter <http://twitter.com>`_ is a great service, but once you start following
more than a hundred people, it becomes time-consuming to keep on top of the
information overload.

I believe that a lot of innovation is possible on the client-side to help people
be more productive and get a lot more value from using Twitter.

  </div>

**Why Will TweetPlex Be Great?**

* Shareable Trust Maps for filtering your Twitter stream.
* Pecus -- a form of reputation currency.
* Web-based. Use it anywhere -- Home, Work, iPhone.
* Ease of managing friends/followers.
* Integration with LinkedIn, Skype, FriendFeed, GitHub, Seesmic and Facebook.
* Real-time statistics.
* Collaborative features like: want, offer, campaign.
* Twitter/Facebook events integrated with Google Calendar.
* Location-aware so you can know what's happening near you.
* Live updates -- no more refreshing.
* Language detection and auto-translate feature.
* Integrated media player for YouTubes and MP3s.
* Use multiple Twitter/Laconica accounts at the same time.
* Easily extendable and customisable.

All this in a simple interface!

**How Does TweetPlex Help Overcome Information Overload?**

With `Trust Maps <espra-bootstrap.html#trust-maps>`_. This is just an easy way
to group people you are following into different contexts -- optionally filtered
by hashtags like #tech, #music, #food, etc. You will also be able to make Trust
Maps public so that everyone can benefit.

The different contexts would be displayed in columns -- similar to the excellent
`TweetDeck <http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/>`_ app -- but unlike TweetDeck, you
will be able to use TweetPlex anywhere with a decent web browser. Home. Office.
iPhone. There'd be no need to go through the
install-configure-upgrade-on-every-machine-you-use bollocks.

**How Will You Make Money?**

By charging for it. I know. It's insane -- charging for a product on the
internet? ;p

Seriously, I believe TweetPlex will save many users enough time that a cost like
£29.99/year should be more than reasonable. I also have plans for a sustainable
free "lite" version that doesn't involve banner/Google ads. But one step at a
time.

**What's The Thank You Box?**

I believe that gratitude should be visible. So there'll be a small box on the
TweetPlex interface which will say "Made possible thanks to:" followed by a link
to a giver's profile page and Twitter bio.

The number of times any individual giver is promoted through the Thank You box
will be proportional to the number of shares they have -- with a maximum of
10,000 page views per share. That is, someone who has got 100 shares will be
promoted in the Thank You box for a maximum of 1 million page views on
TweetPlex.

**What More Will I Get?**

Besides your share(s) in the company, I'll be keeping you informed on progress
and creating many opportunities for you to get directly involved.

This is just the beginning of a story...

With the first working release of TweetPlex out of the way, we'll go on to
tackle big questions like:

* How can we all do what we love *and* live comfortably?
* How can we efficiently organise people, ideas and resources?
* How can we be united in our diversity so that culture can truly flourish?

You'll have front row seats and will hopefully get actively involved in the
creation of things like:

* Web 4.0 -- a Web 4 the people, by the people
* The establishment of a reputation-based economy

**What Will Set TweetPlex Apart?**

The attention to the finer details. Most Twitter clients seem to add features
and icons without much regard to the user experience. In contrast, the mantra
with TweetPlex will be "simplicity beyond complexity".

As a simple example, when you post a message using most Twitter clients, they
will hang if Twitter's servers are down. In contrast, TweetPlex will save your
messages in the "cloud" and automatically post them when Twitter's servers come
back up.

**Will TweetPlex Be Open Source?**

The reason I'm creating TweetPlex is to make money to fund the development of
the `Plexnet <http://github.com/tav/plexnet>`_ [`draft spec
<http://tav.espians.com/plexnet.html>`_] -- a crazily ambitious set of Open Web
extensions that could turn the Web into a truly decentralised operating system.

*The following paragraph is slightly technical, so skip to the next one if you prefer...*

TweetPlex itself won't be open source but it'll be compatible with the open
source Laconica framework and during the course of developing TweetPlex, I'll be
extensively adding to my `Tweetapp <http://github.com/tav/tweetapp>`_ framework
for App Engine.

**Is £10 All It Takes to Have a Share?**

.. http://www.ageofstupid.net/money

Yes, £10 will get you a share and help make TweetPlex happen.

The 1,000 shares constitute 10% of a new company that I will be setting up later
today. That is, 100 shares (£1000) gets you 1% of the new company.

**What Will The Money Be Spent On?**

It'll go towards paying the basic living costs of myself and the handful of
collaborators who will be working with me on TweetPlex.

**How Long Will It Take?**

TweetPlex will be ready for use within 3 months of this fundraiser being
completed.

**Who Are You?**

My name is Tav. I am a 27 year old from London. Just read the `frontpage of my
blog <index.html>`_ or the `about tav <about-tav.html>`_ article to get a feel
for who I am.

**Will This Count As A Birthday Present?**

Yes, for those of you too lazy to get me a present last week, this will be good
enough ;p

Thank you for reading this far and thank you to everyone who gives.

.. And if you've given, please look out for an email from me -- tav@espians.com -- I'll

   And, oh, `follow me `_ on Twitter ;p
