Choosing A Profile Picture
==========================

:X-Created: [2008-06-29, 08:20]

Some people are `photogenic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogenic>`_. Some
are not. Some people love seeing pictures of themselves. Some people don't. I
belong to the second category in both cases.

Having generally avoided cameras my entire life, I was a bit lost when friends
suggested that I should change the "profile" picture I was using in video
presentations.

First of all, there were few photos in existence. Secondly, they pretty much
always had other people in them or weren't taken in a professional context.

How do other people choose profile pictures? Do people have so many pictures of
themselves that it's not much of hassle? Am I abnormal to have so few pictures
of myself?

In fact, one of the few suitable pictures was the one of `me on wikipedia
<http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Ian_Clarke_and_Espra%27s_tav_2001.jpg>`_:

         alt="Ian Clarke and Espra's Tav -- 2001" />
  </div>

But it was taken when I was 18 -- in 2001. *Sigh*! I was left with no choice but
to go down the narcissistic route. Time to have pictures taken of myself! Woo!

Cameras have always failed to capture my charisma. But what the hell -- time to
face the camera. After 15 minutes of having photos taken by Tommy and Xiao, we
arrived at:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="center">
    <img src="http://release.plexnet.org/gfx/tav.blog/tav.profile.jpg"
         alt="Tav Espian" width="200px" height="300px" />
  </div>

It's my new "official" profile picture. What does everyone think? Does it convey
the "Tav Essence" at all?
