======================================================
Fabric Python with Cleaner API and Parallel Deployment
======================================================

`Fabric <http://fabfile.org/>`_ is an awesome tool. Like `Capistrano
<https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/2.x-Getting-Started>`_ and `Vlad
<http://rubyhitsquad.com/Vlad_the_Deployer.html>`_, it makes deployments a lot
simpler than with shell scripts on their own.

However, once the complexity of your setup starts to grow, you very quickly
start wishing for a cleaner and more powerful API.

And once you are deploying to more than 30 servers, you really wish that Fabric
would run commands in parallel instead of doing them sequentially, one after
another.

Having recently experienced this pain, I decided to rework the core of Fabric.
I've documented it below -- describing all the changes to the `current Fabric
1.0a <http://docs.fabfile.org/1.0a/>`_ -- including funky new features like
``fab shell`` and staged deployments!

Task Decorator
--------------

Traditionally, *all* functions within your ``fabfile.py`` were implicitly
exposed as Fabric commands. So once you started abstracting your script to be
more manageable, you had to use ``_underscore`` hacks to stop functions being
exposed as commands, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  from support.module import SomeClass as _SomeClass
  from urllib import urlencode as _urlencode, urlopen as _urlopen

  def _support_function():
      ...

Not only is this ugly and cumbersome, but it also goes against `The Zen of
Python <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_ philosophy of "explicit is
better than implicit". So I've added a ``@task`` decorator to explicitly mark
functions as Fabric commands, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  from urllib import urlopen
  from fabric.api import *


  def get_latest_commit():
      return urlopen('http://commits.server.com/latest').read()


  @task
  def check():
      """check if local changes have been committed"""

      local_version = local('git rev-parse HEAD')

      if local_version != get_latest_commit():
          abort("!! Local changes haven't been committed !!")


  @task
  def deploy():
      """publish the latest version of the app"""

      with cd('/var/app'):
          run('git remote update')
          run('git checkout %s' % get_latest_commit())

      sudo("/etc/init.d/apache2 graceful")

The above uses ``@task`` to explicitly mark ``check`` and ``deploy`` as Fabric
commands so that they can be run as usual, i.e. ``fab check`` and ``fab
deploy``. Any functions and classes you import or define don't have to be
"hidden" with the ``_underscore`` hack.

For backwards compatibility, if you never use the ``@task`` decorator, you'll
continue to get the traditional behaviour.


YAML Config
-----------

It's preferable not to hard-code configurable values into fabfiles. This enables
you to reuse the same fabfile across different projects and keep it updated
without having to constantly copy, paste and modify.

So I've added native config support to Fabric. You can enable it by simply
specifying the ``env.config_file`` variable:

.. syntax:: python

  env.config_file = 'deploy.yaml'

This will load and parse the specified `YAML file
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ before running any commands. The
configuration values will then be accessible from ``env.config``. This object is
simply a dictionary with dot-attribute access similar to the ``env`` dictionary.

You can then keep your fabfiles clean from hard-coded values, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  def get_latest_commit():
      return urlopen(env.config.commits_server).read()


  @task
  def deploy():
      with cd(env.config.app_directory):
          ...

Having configurable values also means that frameworks like Django could ship
default tasks for you to use, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  from django.fabric import deploy, test


Script Execution
----------------

It really helps to be able to quickly iterate the scripts that you will be
calling with Fabric. And whilst you should eventually create them as individual
files and sync them as part of your deployment, it'd be nice if you could try
them out during development.

To help with this I've added a new ``execute()`` builtin. This lets you execute
arbitrary scripts on remote hosts, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def stats():

      memusage = execute("""

        #! /usr/bin/env python
        import psutil

        pid = open('pidfile').read()
        process = psutil.Process(int(pid))
        print process.get_memory_percent()

      """, 'memusage.py', verbose=False, dir='/var/ampify')

Behind the scenes, ``execute()`` will:

* Strip any common leading whitespace from every line in the source.

* Copy the source into a file on the remote server.

* If the optional ``name`` parameter (the 2nd parameter) had been specified,
  then the given name will be used, otherwise an auto-generated name will be
  used.

* If the optional ``dir`` parameter was specified, then the file will be created
  within the given directory, otherwise it'll be created on the remote ``$HOME``
  directory.

* The file will then be made executable, i.e. ``chmod +x``.

* And, finally, it will be run and the response will be returned. Unless the
  ``verbose`` parameter is set to ``False``, then it will by default also output
  the response to the screen.

As you can imagine, ``execute()`` makes it very easy to rapidly try out and
develop your development logic. Your scripts can be in whatever languages you
can run on your remote hosts -- Ruby, Perl, Bash, Python, JavaScript, whatever.


Environment Variable Manager
----------------------------

When calling various command line tools, you often have to mess with environment
variables like ``$PATH``, ``$NODE_PATH``, ``$PYTHONPATH``, etc. To deal with
this, Fabric forced you to write things like:

.. syntax:: python

  NODE_PATH = "NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:%s" % node_libs
  run("%s vows" % NODE_PATH)
  run("%s coffee -c amp.coffee" % NODE_PATH)

Instead you can now do:

.. syntax:: python

  with env.NODE_PATH(node_libs):
      run("vows")
      run("coffee -c amp.coffee")

That is, if you call a property on the ``env`` object which is composed of only
the ``ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_`` characters, then a `Python Context Manager
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/>`_ is generated which will manage the
use of the environment variables for you.

The manager has the following constructor signature:

.. syntax:: python

  manager(value, behaviour='append', sep=os.pathsep, reset=False)

So, if you'd called ``env.PATH(value, behaviour)``, the way the ``value`` is
treated will depend on the ``behaviour`` parameter which can be one of the
following:

* ``append`` -- appends value to the current ``$PATH``, i.e.
  ``PATH=$PATH:<value>``

* ``prepend`` -- prepends value to the current ``$PATH``, i.e.
  ``PATH=<value>:$PATH``

* ``replace`` -- ignores ``$PATH`` altogether, i.e. ``PATH=<value>``

The ``sep`` defaults to ``:`` on most platforms and determines how the values
are concatenated. However, if you call the manager with no arguments at all or
stringify it, it will return the string which would be used during execution,
e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  print env.NODE_PATH               # NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/opt/ampify/libs/node

The various calls can be also nested, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  with env.PATH('/usr/local/bin'):
      with env.PATH('/home/tav/bin'):
          print env.PATH               # PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/home/tav/bin
          with env.PATH('/opt/local/bin', 'replace'):
              with env.PATH('/bin', 'prepend'):
                  print env.PATH       # PATH=/bin:/opt/local/bin
      print env.PATH                   # PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

You can specify ``reset=True`` to discard any nested values, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  with env.PATH('/opt/ampify/bin', 'prepend'):
      with env.PATH('/home/tav/bin', reset=True):
          print env.PATH                              # PATH=$PATH:/home/tav/bin


Extension Hooks
---------------

I've added native hooks support so that you can extend certain aspects of Fabric
without having to resort to monkey-patching. You attach functions to specific
hooks by using the new ``@hook`` decorator, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @hook('config.loaded')
  def default_config():

      if 'port' in env.config:
          return

      port = prompt("port number?", default=8080, validate=int)
      env.config.port = port

For the moment, only the following builtin hooks are defined. It's possible that
I may add support for individual ``<command>.before`` and ``<command>.after``
hooks, but so far I haven't needed that functionality.

+---------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| Hook Name           | Hook Function Signature     | Description            |
+=====================+=============================+========================+
| ``commands.before`` | ``func(cmds, cmds_to_run)`` | |hook-commands-before| |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| ``config.loaded``   | ``func()``                  | |hook-config-loaded|   |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| ``commands.after``  | ``func()``                  | |hook-commands-after|  |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
| ``listing.display`` | ``func()``                  | |hook-listing-display| |
+---------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+

.. |hook-config-loaded| replace::

  Run after any config file has been parsed and loaded.

.. |hook-commands-after| replace::

  Run after *all* the commands are run.

.. |hook-commands-before| replace::

  Run before *all* the commands are run (including the config handling).

.. |hook-listing-display| replace::

  Run when the commands listing has finished running in response to ``fab`` or
  ``fab --list``. Useful for adding extra info.

You can access the functions attached to a specific hook by calling
``hook.get()``, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  functions = hook.get('config.loaded')

You can also define your own custom hooks and call the attached functions by
using ``hook.call()``. This takes the hook name as the first parameter and all
subsequent parameters are used when calling the hook's attached functions.

Here's an example that shows ``hook.call()`` in action along with ``env.hook``
and the ability to attach the same function to multiple hooks by passing
multiple names to the ``@hook`` decorator:

.. syntax:: python

  @hook('deploy.success', 'deploy.failure')
  def irc_notify(release_id, info=None):
      client = IrcClient('devbot', 'irc.freenode.net', '#esp')
      if env.hook == 'deploy.success':
          client.msg("Successfully deployed: %s" % release_id)
      else:
          client.msg("Failed deployment: %s" % release_id)


  @hook('deploy.success')
  def webhook_notify(release_id, info):
      webhook.post({'id': release_id, 'payload': info})


  @task
  def deploy():
      release_id = get_release_id()
      try:
          ...
          info = get_release_info()
      except Exception:
          hook.call('deploy.failure', release_id)
      else:
          hook.call('deploy.success', release_id, info)

And, finally, you can disable specific hooks via the ``--disable-hooks`` command
line option which takes space-separated patterns, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab deploy --disable-hooks 'config.loaded deploy.*'

You can override these disabled hooks in turn with the ``--enable-hooks``
option, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab deploy --disable-hooks 'deploy.*' --enable-hooks 'deploy.success'

Both ``hook.call()`` and ``hook.get()`` respect these command-line parameters,
so if you ever need to access the raw hook registry dict, you can access it
directly via ``hook.registry``.


Interpolation & Directories Support
-----------------------------------

Fabric provides a number of builtin functions that let you make command line
calls:

* ``local()`` -- runs a command on the local host.

* ``run()`` -- runs a command on a remote host.

* ``sudo()`` -- runs a sudoed command on a remote host.

I've added two optional parameters to these. A ``dir`` parameter can be used to
specify the directory from within which the command should be run, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def restart():
      run("amp restart", dir='/opt/ampify')

And a ``format`` parameter can be used to access the new formatted strings
functionality, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def backup():
      run("backup.rb {app_directory} {s3_key}", format=True)

This makes use of the `Advanced String Formatting
<http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/>`_ support that is available in Python
2.6 and later. The ``env`` object is used to look-up the various parameters,
i.e. the above is equivalent to:

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def backup():
      command = "backup.rb {app_directory} {s3_key}".format(**env)
      run(command)

By default, ``format`` is set to ``False`` and the string is run without any
substitution. But if you happen to find formatting as useful a I do, you can
enable it as default by setting:

.. syntax:: python

  env.format = True

You can then use it without having to constantly set ``format=True``, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def backup():
      run("backup.rb {app_directory} {s3_key}")


Fabric Contexts
---------------

I've used Fabric for everything from simple single-machine deployments to web
app deployments across multiple data centers to even physical multi-touch
installations at the `Museum of Australian Democracy
<http://www.moadoph.gov.au/exhibitions/prime-ministers-of-australia-exhibition/>`_.

And for everything but the simplest of setups, I've had to work around the
limited support offered by Fabric's ``@hosts`` and ``@roles`` in terms of:

* Managing configurable ``env`` values when dealing with different servers.

* Executing workflows involving distinct sets of servers within the same Fabric
  command, e.g. app servers, db servers, load balancers, etc.

And, clearly, I am `not
<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/fab-user/2009-05/msg00027.html>`_ `the
<http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/fab-user/2010-09/msg00023.html>`_ `only
<http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/fab-user/2010-12/msg00020.html>`_ `one
<http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/fab-user/2011-02/msg00005.html>`_ who has
experienced this pain. So I've introduced the notion of "contexts" and an
``env()`` context runner into the Fabric core. This means that you can now do
things like:

.. syntax:: python

  @task('app-servers')
  def deploy():

      env().run('./manage.py shutdown {app_directory}')
      env('build-servers').run('make build')
      env().run('./manage.py upgrade {app_directory}'
      env().run('./manage.py start {app_directory}'


And run it with a simple:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab deploy

That's right. You no longer have to run insanely long command strings like:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab run_tests freeze_requirements update_repository create_snapshot update_virtualenv update_media update_nginx graceful_migrate

You might occasionally want to make a call on a subset of hosts for particular
contexts. A utility ``.select()`` method is provided to help with this. If you
pass it an integer value, it'll randomly choose as many values from the
settings, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task('build-servers')
  def build():
      env().select(3).run('{build_command}')

The ``.select()`` method can also take a filter function to let you do more
custom selection, e.g. to select 2 build servers for each platform, you might do
something like:

.. syntax:: python

  from itertools import groupby
  from random import sample


  def selector(settings):
      settings = sorted(settings, key=lambda s: s['platform'])
      grouped = groupby(settings, lambda s: s['platform'])
      return [sample(list(group), 2) for platform, group in grouped]


  @task('build-servers')
  def build():
      env().select(selector).run('{build_command}')

And since deployment setups vary tremendously, instead of trying to make one
size fit all, I've made it so that you can define your own
``env.get_settings()`` function, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  from fabric.network import host_regex


  def get_settings(ctx):
      return [{
          'host_string': host_string,
          'host': host_regex.match(host_string).groupdict()['host']
          } for host_string in ctx]


  env.get_settings = get_settings

If any of the hosts threw an exception, then the corresponding element within
``responses`` will contain it. Two new builtins are provided to quickly
determine the nature of the response:

* ``succeeded`` -- returns True if all the response items were successful.

* ``failed`` -- returns True if any of the response items failed or threw an
  exception.

You can loop through the response and the corresponding host/setting values by
using the ``.ziphost()`` and ``.zipsetting()`` generator methods on the returned
list-like ``responses`` object, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def deploy():
      responses = env('app-servers').multirun('make build')
      for response, host in responses.ziphost():
          ...

You can override the context for a task directly from the command line with the
new ``@context`` syntax, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab example1 @dev1.ampify.it
  ['dev1.ampify.it']


Parallel Deployment
-------------------

You no longer have to patiently wait whilst Fabric runs your commands on each
server one by one. By taking advantage of the ``.multirun()`` context runner
call, you can now run commands in parallel, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def deploy():
      responses = env('app-servers').multirun('make build')
      if failed(responses):
          ...

The above will run ``make build`` on the ``app-servers`` in parallel -- reducing
your deployment time significantly! The returned ``responses`` will be a list of
the individual responses from each host in order, just like with ``.run()``.

If any of the hosts threw an exception, then the corresponding element within
``responses`` will contain it. Exceptions will not be raised, irregardless of
whether you'd set ``warn_only`` -- it is up to you to deal with them.

By default you see the output from all hosts, but sometimes you just want a
summary, so you can specify ``condensed=True`` to ``.multirun()`` and it'll
provide a much quieter, running report instead, e.g.

::

  [multirun] Running 'make build test' on 31 hosts
  [multirun] Finished on dev2.ampify.it
  [multirun] Finished on dev7.ampify.it
  [multirun] 2/31 completed ...

Also, when dealing with large number of servers, you'll run into laggy servers
from time to time. And depending on your setup, it may not be critical that
*all* servers run the command. To help with this ``.multirun()`` takes two
optional parameters:

* ``laggards_timeout`` -- the number of seconds to wait for laggards once the
  satisfactory number of responses have been received -- needs to be an int
  value.

* ``wait_for`` -- the number of responses to wait for -- this should be an int,
  but can also be a float value between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``, in which case it'll
  be used as the factor of the total number of servers.

So, for the following:

.. syntax:: python

  responses = env('app-servers').multirun(
      'make build', laggards_timeout=20, wait_for=0.8
      )

The ``make build`` command will be run on the various ``app-servers`` and once
80% of the responses have been received, it'll continue to wait up to 20 seconds
for any laggy servers before returning the responses.

The ``responses`` list will contain the new ``TIMEOUT`` builtin object for the
servers that didn't return a response in time. Like with the ``.run()`` context
runner call, ``.multirun()`` also accepts a function to execute instead of a
command string, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  env.format = True


  def migrate_db():
      run('./manage.py schemamigration --auto {app_name}')
      run('./manage.py migrate {app_name}')


  @task
  def deploy():
      env('frontends').multirun('routing --disable')
      env('app-nodes').multirun(migrate_db)
      env('frontends').multirun('routing --enable')


  @task
  def migrate():
      env('app-nodes').multirun(migrate_db)

There's also a ``.multilocal()`` which runs the command locally for each of the
hosts in parallel, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  env.format = True

  @task
  def db_backup():
      env('db-servers').multilocal('backup.rb {host}')

Behind the scenes, ``.multirun()`` uses ``fork()`` and `domain sockets
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket>`_, so it'll only work on Unix
platforms. You can specify the maximum number of parallel processes to spawn at
any one time by specifying ``env.multirun_pool_size`` which is set to ``10`` by
default, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  env.multirun_pool_size = 200

There's also an ``env.multirun_child_timeout`` which specifies the number of
seconds a child process will wait to hear from the parent before committing
suicide. It defaults to ``10`` seconds, but you can configure it to suit your
setup:

.. syntax:: python

  env.multirun_child_timeout = 24

And, oh, there's also a ``.multisudo()`` for your convenience.


Fabric Shell
------------

Sometimes you just want to run a bunch of commands on a number of different
servers. So I've added a funky new feature -- Fabric shell mode:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="center">
    <a href="https://skitch.com/tav./rqccu/python" title="Fabric Shell"><img
       src="http://img.skitch.com/20110212-g8ha9cd5g441m4q3y21gewmnha.png" /></a>
  </div>

Once you are in the shell, all of your commands will be sequentially ``run()``
on the respective hosts for your calling context. You can also use the
``.shell-command`` syntax to call shell builtin commands -- including your own
custom ones!

You start shells from within your Fabric commands by invoking the ``.shell()``
method of a context runner. Here's sample code to enable ``fab shell``:

.. syntax:: python

  @task('app-servers')
  def shell():
      """start a shell within the current context"""

      env().shell(format=True)

The above defaults to the ``app-servers`` context when you run ``fab shell``,
but you can always override the context from the command line, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab shell @db-servers

And if your Python has been compiled with `readline support
<http://docs.python.org/library/readline.html>`_, then you can also leverage the
tab-completion support that I've added:

* Terms starting with ``{`` auto-complete on the properties within the ``env``
  object to make it easy for you to use the string formatting support.

* Terms starting with ``.`` auto-complete on the available shell builtin
  commands.

* All other terms auto-complete on the list of available executables on your
  local machine's ``$PATH``.

Other readline features have been enabled too, e.g. command history with up/down
arrows, ``^r`` search and even cross-session history. You can configure where
the history is saved by setting ``env.shell_history_file`` which defaults to:

.. syntax:: python

  env.shell_history_file = '~/.fab-shell-history'


Shell Builtins
--------------

As mentioned above, you can call various ``.shell-commands`` from within a
Fabric shell to do something other than ``run()`` a command on the various
hosts, e.g.

.. syntax:: irb

  >> .multilocal backup.rb {host_string}

The above will run the equivalent of the following in parallel for each host:

.. syntax:: python

  local("backup.rb {host_string}")

The following builtins are currently available:

* ``.cd`` -- changes the working directory for all future commands.

* ``.help`` -- displays a list of the available shell commands.

* ``.info`` -- list the current context and the respective hosts.

* ``.local`` -- runs the command locally.

* ``.multilocal`` -- runs the command in parallel locally for each host.

* ``.multirun`` -- runs the command in parallel on the various hosts.

* ``.multisudo`` -- runs the sudoed command in parallel on the various hosts.

* ``.sudo`` -- runs the sudoed command on the various hosts.

* ``.toggle-format`` -- toggles string formatting support.

You can define your own by using the new ``@shell`` decorator, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

    @shell
    def python_version(spec, arg):
        with hide('running', 'output'):
            if arg == 'full':
                version = run('python -c "import sys; print sys.version"')
            else:
                version = run(
                    "python -c 'import sys; print "
                    '".".join(map(str, sys.version_info[:3]))\''
                    )
        puts("python %s" % version)

The above can then be called from within a shell, e.g.

.. syntax:: irb

  >> .python-version
  [dev1.ampify.it] python 2.5.2
  [dev3.ampify.it] python 2.7.0

The ``spec`` object is initialised with the various variables that the
``.shell()`` method was originally called with, e.g. ``dir``, ``format``, etc.
All changes made, e.g. ``spec.dir = '/var/ampify'``, are persistent and will
affect all subsequent commands within the shell.

The ``arg`` is a string value of everything following the shell command name,
e.g. for ``.local echo hi``, it will be ``"echo hi"``. The command name is
derived from the function name, but you can provide your own as the first
parameter to the ``@shell`` decorator.

And, finally, you can specify ``single=True`` to the ``@shell`` decorator to
specify that you only want the command to be run a single time and not
repeatedly for every host, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @shell('hello', single=True)
  def demo(spec, arg):
      print "Hello", arg.upper()

The above can then be called from within a shell, e.g.

.. syntax:: irb

  >> .hello tav
  Hello TAV

The ``env.ctx`` is set for even single-mode shell commands, so you can always
take advantage of context runners, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @shell
  def backup(spec, arg):
      env().multirun(...)


Command Line Listing
--------------------

When ``fab`` was run without any arguments, it used to spit out the help message
with the various command line options:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab
  Usage: fab [options] <command>[:arg1,arg2=val2,host=foo,hosts='h1;h2',...] ...

  Options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
    -l, --list            print list of possible commands and exit
    --shortlist           print non-verbose list of possible commands and exit
    -d COMMAND, --display=COMMAND
                          print detailed info about a given command and exit
  ...

As useful as this was, I figured it'd be more useful to list the various
commands without having to constantly type ``fab --list``. So now when you run
``fab`` without any arguments, it lists the available commands instead, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab
  Available commands:

      check    check if local changes have been committed
      deploy   publish the latest version of the app

You can of course still access the help message by running either ``fab -h`` or
``fab --help``. And you can hide commands from being listed by specifying
``display=None`` with the ``@task`` decorator, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task(display=None)
  def armageddon():
      ...


Staged Deployment
-----------------

For most serious deployments, you tend to have distinct environments, e.g.
testing, staging, production, etc. And `existing
<http://blog.jeremi.info/entry/my-git-workflow-to-deploy-an-application-to-appengine>`_
`fabric <http://lethain.com/entry/2008/nov/04/deploying-django-with-fabric/>`__
`setups <https://github.com/bueda/ops>`_ tend to have similarly named commands
so you can run things like:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab production deploy

Now, not being a fan of repeatedly adding the same functionality to all my
fabfiles, I've added staged deployment support to Fabric. You can enable it by
specifying an ``env.stages`` list value, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  env.stages = ['staging', 'production']

The first item in the list is taken to be the *default* and overridable commands
of the following structure are automatically generated for each item:

.. syntax:: python

  @task(display=None)
  def production():
      puts("env.stage = production", prefix='system')
      env.stage = 'production'

That is, it will update ``env.stage`` with the appropriate value and print out a
message saying so, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab production check deploy
  [system] env.stage = production
  ...

And if your fab command line call didn't start with one of the stages, it will
automatically run the one for the default stage, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab check deploy
  [system] env.stage = staging
  ...

For added convenience, the environments are also listed when you run ``fab``
without any arguments, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab
  Available commands:

      check    check if local changes have been committed
      deploy   publish the latest version of the app

  Available environments:

      staging
      production

And, for further flexibility, you can override ``env.stages`` with the
``FAB_STAGES`` environment variable. This takes a comma-separated list of
environment stages and, again, the first is treated as the default, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ FAB_STAGES=development,production fab deploy
  [system] env.stage = development
  ...


Hyphenated Commands
-------------------

This is a minor point, but I find hyphens, e.g. ``deploy-ampify``, to be more
aesthetically pleasing than underscores, i.e. ``deploy_ampify``. So Fabric now
displays and supports hyphenated variants of all commands, e.g. for the
following fabfile:

.. syntax:: python

  from fabric.api import *

  @task
  def deploy_ampify():
      """deploy the current version of ampify"""
      ...

The command listing shows:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab
  Available commands:

      deploy-ampify  deploy the current version of ampify

And you can run the command with:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab deploy-ampify


Command Line Env Flags
----------------------

You can now update the ``env`` object directly from the command line using the
new env flags syntax:

* ``+<key>`` sets the value of the key to ``True``.

* ``+<key>:<value>`` sets the key to the given string value.

So, for the following content in your fabfile:

.. syntax:: python

  env.config_file = 'deploy.yaml'
  env.debug = False

Running the following will set ``env.config_file`` to the new value:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab <commands> +config_file:alt.yaml

And the following will set ``env.debug`` to ``True``:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab <commands> +debug

The env flags are all set in the order given on the command line and before any
commands are run (including the config file handling if one is specified). And
you can, of course, specify as many env flags as you want.


Optimisations
-------------

It won't make much of a difference, but for my own sanity I've made a bunch of
minor optimisations to Fabric, e.g.

* Removed repeated look-up of attributes within loops.

* Removed repeated local imports within functions.

* Removed redundant double-wrapping of functions within the ``@hosts`` and
  ``@roles`` decorators.


Colors Support
--------------

You can enable the optional colors support by setting ``env.colors``, i.e.

.. syntax:: python

  env.colors = True

Here's a screenshot of it in action:

.. raw:: html

  <div class="center">
    <a href="https://skitch.com/tav./rqge6/fabric-shell"><img
       src="http://img.skitch.com/20110211-nep3wmpi33qb2c4a13bf7fsgja.png"
       alt="Fabric with Colors" /></a>
  </div>

You can customise the colors by modifying the ``env.color_settings`` property.
By default it is set to:

.. syntax:: python

  env.color_settings = {
      'abort': yellow,
      'error': yellow,
      'finish': cyan,
      'host_prefix': green,
      'prefix': red,
      'prompt': blue,
      'task': red,
      'warn': yellow
      }

You can find the color functions in the ``fabric.colors`` module.


Logging Improvements
--------------------

The builtin ``puts()`` and ``fastprint()`` logging functions have also been
extended with the optional ``format`` parameter and ``env.format`` support
similar to the ``local()`` and ``run()`` builtins, so that instead of having to
do something like:

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def db_migrate():
      puts(
        "[%s] [database] migrating schemas for %s" %
        (env.host_string, env.db_name)
        )

You can now just do:

.. syntax:: python

  env.format = True

  @task
  def db_migrate():
      puts("migrating schemas for {db_name}", 'database')

And it will output something like:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab db-migrate
  [somehost.com] [database] migrating schemas for ampify

The second parameter which was previously a boolean-only value that was used to
control whether the host string was printed or not, can now also be a string
value -- in which case the string will be used as the prefix instead of the host
string.

You can still control if a host prefix is *also* printed by using the new
optional ``show_host`` parameter, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  @task
  def db_migrate():
      puts("migrating schemas for {db_name}", 'database', show_host=False)

Will output something like:

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab db-migrate
  [database] migrating schemas for ampify

And if you'd enabled ``env.colors``, the prefix will be also colored according
to your settings!


Autocompletion
--------------

`Bash completion <http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/316>`_ is one of
those features that really helps you to be more productive. Just include the
following in your ``~/.bashrc`` or equivalent file and you'll be able to use
Fabric's new command completion support:

.. syntax:: bash

  _fab_completion() {
      COMPREPLY=( $( \
      COMP_LINE=$COMP_LINE  COMP_POINT=$COMP_POINT \
      COMP_WORDS="${COMP_WORDS[*]}"  COMP_CWORD=$COMP_CWORD \
      OPTPARSE_AUTO_COMPLETE=1 $1 ) )
  }

  complete -o default -F _fab_completion fab

It completes on all available commands and command line options, e.g.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab --dis<tab>
  --disable-known-hosts    --disable-hooks    --display

Also, since Fabric has no way of knowing which `command line env flags`_ and
contexts you might be using, you can specify additional autocompletion items as
an ``env.autocomplete`` list value, e.g.

.. syntax:: python

  env.autocomplete = ['+config_file:', '+debug', '@db-servers']

This will then make those values available for you to autocomplete, i.e.

.. syntax:: console

  $ fab +<tab>
  +config_file:    +debug


Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

All these changes should be fully backwards compatible. That is, unless you
happen to have specified any of the new ``env`` variables like ``env.stages``,
your existing fabfiles should run as they've always done. Do let me know if this
is not the case...


Usage
-----

If you'd like to take advantage of these various changes, the simplest thing to
do is to clone my `pylibs repository <https://github.com/tav/pylibs>`_ and put
it on your ``$PYTHONPATH``, i.e.

.. syntax:: console

  $ git clone git://github.com/tav/pylibs.git

  $ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`/pylibs

Then create a ``fab`` script somewhere on your ``$PATH`` with the following
content:

.. syntax:: python

  #! /usr/bin/env python

  from fabric.main import main

  main()

Make sure the script is executable, i.e.

.. syntax:: console

  $ chmod +x fab

And as long as you have Python 2.6+, you should be good to go...

.. class:: intro-box

Next Steps
----------

I have been talking to the Fabric maintainers about merging these changes
upstream. And so far they've been quite positive. But, as you can imagine, there
are a number of competing ideas about what is best for Fabric's future.

So if you like these features, then do leave a comment expressing your support.
It'd really help getting these features into the next version of Fabric.
