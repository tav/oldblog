After a week of heavy pondering, I have nailed down the required functionality
for Bootstrap. Have a read:

* `Boostrap draft specification <espra-bootstrap.html>`_

Then let me know what you think in the comments below!

Bear in mind that this is *not* Espra. It is *not* based on the Plexnet. It is
*not* decentralised. It is *not* meant to scale to millions of users. It is only
meant to achieve the following:

1. Enable interesting small-scale communities, e.g. socialaction.tv
2. Demonstrate *some* of Espra's utility, e.g. Trust Maps.
3. Establish credibility with the world that the Espians can code =)
4. Be a powerful communications tool to facilitate Espra's development.
5. Bring in short-term consultancy revenue.
