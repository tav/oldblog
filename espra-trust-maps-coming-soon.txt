Espra Trust Maps: Coming Soon!
==============================

My apologies to the thousand-odd readers of this blog for not writing recently.
I've been busy working with a great group of individuals on `Iteration X
<http://www.espians.com/iteration-x.html>`_.

There's not much public yet, but I am very happy to let you know that the first
part of it, `Espra Trust Maps <http://www.trustmap.org>`_, will be landing in
the next few weeks -- I hope you'll like it!

  <div class="center">

  </div>

If you'd like to know about all the other cool developments that have been
happening, see the Iteration X `Progress Summary
<http://www.espians.com/iteration-x-progress-summary.html>`_ article. Some
highlights include:

* An initial implementation of the `Plexnet data
  <http://inamidst.com/stuff/esp/plexdata>`_ model. [`code
  <http://github.com/tav/plexnet/blob/master/source/plexnet/core/data.py>`__]

* A webkit bridge that binds together our PyPy interpreter with WebKit! Python
  in your web browser babeh! [`code
  <http://github.com/tav/plexnet/tree/master/source/client/webkit_bridge>`__]

I've also been writing some articles on the new `Espians
<http://www.espians.com>`_ website. Some of you might find the following
interesting:

* `Why App Engine is not appropriate for Bootstrap

And, oh, the amazing `Howard Rheingold <http://www.rheingold.com/>`_ joined our
`Board of Mentors <http://www.espians.com/board-of-mentors.html>`_!
