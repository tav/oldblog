Becoming a Film Maker
=====================

:X-Created: [2009-03-06, 05:38]

I've decided to ease into film making by becoming a video blogger. By the time I
am proficient enough with video editing, the stage should be set for `ractives

So I need your help. Because I know fuck all about filming or editing.

Despite creating the likes of `green.tv
<http://www.green.tv>`_ and setting up an entire company to provide online video
services, my knowledge of film making is close to non-existent.

If you want to know about scalable online distribution or digital video
encoding, then I can give you expert advice. But film making? Not a clue.

The closest I've ever gotten to actual editing was as part of the Video
Production Society at `Dulwich College <http://www.dulwich.org.uk>`_. Back then
it was mostly analog and Adobe Premiere 1.0 just gave me lots of headaches.

So as I get back into it over 15 years later, my setup is:

* Core 2 Duo 2.4Ghz Macbook w/ 4GB of RAM
* External 1TB Networked Hard Drive
* iLife '08, iWork '09
* Final Cut Express, Logic Express

Is this good enough? I didn't go for the Pro versions given the price and
decided to ease myself in with the Express versions. Would iMovie have been
enough?

What are tutorials, podcasts and websites I should check out to get started very
quickly?

As for the video capturing process, should I shell out on an actual camera or is
something like `the Flip <http://www.theflip.com/>`_ good enough to get started
with?

I've been drooling over the `Canon 5D Mark II
<http://gizmodo.com/tag/canon-5d-mark-ii/>`_. It produces the stunning visuals
you see in this article!!

I don't of course expect to produce anything quite so spectacular yet. But if
one day I could afford to buy it, would it be any better than a Flip in the
hands of a newbie like myself?

And, finally, instead of hosting the videos myself, it seems that it's better to
put them up on sites with active communities.

I've `signed up to Vimeo <http://www.vimeo.com/asktav>`_ for this as they seem
to have really vibrant and artistic community. Is this a good choice?

Have any of you been video blogging or film making? What have your experiences
been? Am I approaching all this completely wrong?

Please let me know any thoughts you may have in the comments. Thanks!
